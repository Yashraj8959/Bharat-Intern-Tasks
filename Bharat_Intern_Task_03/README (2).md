# Handwritten Digit Recognition

Welcome to the Handwritten Digit Recognition project! This project demonstrates a simple neural network-based approach to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset and TensorFlow/Keras.

## Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a popular application of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset for this task, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents.

Neural networks, particularly deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown excellent performance in recognizing handwritten digits. The steps involved in creating a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset and a neural network are as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain the MNIST dataset, which contains a large number of images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for training by normalizing the pixel values (typically scaled to a range of 0 to 1), reshaping the images, and converting the labels into one-hot encoded vectors.

3. **Model Architecture**: Design a neural network architecture suitable for image recognition. For MNIST, a common approach is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) due to its effectiveness in handling image data.

4. **Training**: Train the neural network using the preprocessed data. This involves feeding the images into the network, calculating the prediction error, and updating the model's parameters (weights and biases) using optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.

5. **Validation**: Split the dataset into training and validation sets to monitor the model's performance during training. This helps prevent overfitting and allows you to tune hyperparameters.

6. **Testing**: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set that the model has not seen during training to get an unbiased estimate of its performance.

7. **Prediction**: After successful training, the model is capable of predicting the digit present in new scanned images of handwritten digits.

The model's performance can be further improved by applying techniques like data augmentation, dropout, batch normalization, or using more complex architectures like ResNet, DenseNet, etc.

Once the model is trained and validated, it can be deployed as a system that takes images of handwritten digits as input and predicts the corresponding digits. Such systems can be integrated into various applications, such as check digit recognition in banks, postal services, and digit recognition in mobile applications.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you'll need the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Code Structure

The code is organized as follows:

- `handwritten_digit_recognition.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training the model using a CNN architecture and the MNIST dataset. The notebook provides a step-by-step explanation of the code.

- `handwritten_digit_recognition.py`: Python script for training the model and saving it to a file. The script allows you to choose whether to train a new model or load an existing one.

- `digits/`: Folder containing custom images of handwritten digits. These images can be used to test the trained model's predictions.


 ## If you want to train a new model, run the `handwritten_digit_recognition.py` script:

```bash
python handwritten_digit_recognition.py
```

## To use the pre-trained model and test it on custom images, place the images in the `digits/` folder (inverted binary images of handwritten digits) and run the script:

```bash
python handwritten_digit_recognition.py
```

The script will read the custom images, perform predictions, and display the predicted digits along with the images.
