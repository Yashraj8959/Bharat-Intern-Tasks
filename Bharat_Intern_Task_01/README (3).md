# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This repository contains code for predicting the stock prices of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

## Overview

In this project, we use historical stock price data of MSFT to train an LSTM model. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence data, such as time series. The model learns from the historical stock prices to make predictions on future stock prices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn


## Dataset

The historical stock price data is obtained from Yahoo Finance using the `pandas_datareader` library.
## Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preparation, model training, and predictions
