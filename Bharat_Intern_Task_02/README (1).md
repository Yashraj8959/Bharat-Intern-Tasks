Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more.
# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset used in this project is a synthetic Titanic dataset generated for educational purposes.

# Overview
Building a system to predict whether a person would survive the Titanic sinking can be achieved using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this task usually contains information about passengers, including their socio-economic status, age, gender, and more, along with a binary label indicating whether they survived or not.

Here's a step-by-step guide to building such a system:

1. Data Collection: Obtain a dataset that contains information about the Titanic passengers, such as socio-economic status, age, gender, cabin class, family size, fare, etc. You can find datasets for this task on various platforms like Kaggle.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values and converting categorical features to numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding for gender) and normalizing/standardizing numerical features.

3. Feature Selection: Analyze the dataset and select relevant features that may have a significant impact on survival (e.g., socio-economic status, age, gender, cabin class, etc.).

4. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

5. Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for this classification task. Common algorithms used for binary classification tasks include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM).

6. Model Training: Train the selected model on the training set using the selected features.

7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

8. Interpretation: Analyze the model's results to understand which factors had the most significant impact on survival. You can use feature importance scores provided by some algorithms (e.g., Random Forests) or perform feature analysis to gain insights.

9. Model Deployment: Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it as a prediction system that takes input features (e.g., socio-economic status, age, gender) and predicts whether the person is likely to survive or not.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified overview, and the actual implementation might require more fine-tuning and feature engineering. Additionally, always ensure to validate the model's results and avoid overfitting by using proper cross-validation techniques during model training.

Remember, the Titanic dataset is a classic example used to learn about data analysis and machine learning, but it's essential to consider more diverse and up-to-date datasets for real-world applications.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this project contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features like Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, and Embarked. The target variable is 'Survived,' which indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0). I have used this dataset in this project:- https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/tree/master/titanic.csv

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- faker (for generating synthetic data)

## Visualization 
You can add more graphs and visualizations to the code to gain further insights into the Titanic dataset or to present the data in different ways. Visualizations are a powerful tool for data exploration and communication.

Here are some additional graph ideas you can consider adding to the code:

1. **Correlation Heatmap**: Create a correlation heatmap to visualize the correlation between different features and the target variable 'Survived'. This will help you identify which features have a stronger relationship with survival.

2. **Box Plots**: Use box plots to visualize the distribution of numerical features (e.g., Age, Fare) for different survival outcomes. Box plots can help identify potential outliers and differences in distributions between survived and non-survived passengers.

3. **Bar Plots for Other Categorical Variables**: If your dataset contains other categorical variables, you can create bar plots to visualize the relationship between those variables and survival.

4. **Pair Plot**: A pair plot can be helpful to visualize multiple pairwise relationships in the dataset. You can use the Seaborn `pairplot` function to create scatter plots for numerical features and bar plots for categorical features.

5. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Plots**: Use KDE plots to visualize the distribution of numerical features based on survival outcomes. KDE plots provide a smoothed representation of the data distribution.

6. **Facet Grid Plots**: If you have multiple categorical variables, you can use Seaborn's facet grid plots to visualize relationships between numerical features and survival, segmented by different categorical variables.

7. **Stacked Bar Plots**: Create stacked bar plots to visualize combinations of multiple categorical variables with survival outcomes.

8. **Violin Plots**: Violin plots combine box plots and KDE plots to visualize the distribution of numerical features and their densities for different survival outcomes.

Remember to use the appropriate type of visualization based on the nature of the data and the insights you want to gain. You can add these graphs at various stages of the code, such as after data preprocessing or before model evaluation.

Feel free to experiment with different visualizations to better understand the dataset and uncover interesting patterns or relationships between features and survival.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn faker
